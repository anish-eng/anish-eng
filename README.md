## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **second year CS undergraduate at UMass Amherst** passionate about building **reliable, thoughtful software systems** that solve real problems.

I enjoy working across the stack—from **backend systems, infrastructure and APIs** to **clean, user-centric frontends**—with a strong focus on **engineering quality, scalability, and real-world usability**. I have gained diverse experiences through SWE internships, building personal projects at hackathons and more. Excited to keep learning and using my skills to make a difference. 

Alongside development, I’m deeply interested in the intersection of **SWE with AI** and **distributed infrastructure** that allows an application to be scaled and used by millions of users.

💡 *I’m currently seeking Spring / Summer 2026 Software Engineering opportunities (Backend / Full-Stack).  
No U.S. work sponsorship required.*
